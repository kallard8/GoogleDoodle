About Valentine’s Day

Valentine’s day originated from Saint Valentine from the Catholic church. There are many different legends about him. One believes he may have served in the third century in Rome, defying the law against marriage made by Emperor Claudius II and marrying lovers in secret. Only for him to be discovered, and ordered by Claudius to be put to death. 

Some believe Valentine may have been killed from saving Christians from Roman prisons. Others believe he fell in love with a girl who visited him during his confinement- leaving her a letter signed “from your Valentine.” 

Saint Valentine became well known in England and France as a Romantic figure. However, America & Britain are where Valentine’s day is most known to be celebrated
